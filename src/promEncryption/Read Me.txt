
What does it do?

This program decrypts and encrypts SMA-protected games.  This, however, will not make
them playable in emulators such as NeoRage-X, since they are protected as well as
encrypted.


How?

Rename your p1 rom to "p1" (minus the quotes).
Rename your p2 rom to "p2" (minus the quotes).
Rename your sma rom to "sma" (minus the quotes).

or

Rename your decrypted rom to p1_decrypted
this rom must be 8 or 9mb in size

Next, run the program, tell it which game-type you wish to work with. Then, tell the 
program whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the roms.
